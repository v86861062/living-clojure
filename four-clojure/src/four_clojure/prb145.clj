;; Clojure's `for` macro is a tremendously versatile mechanism for producing a
;; sequence based on some other sequence(s). It can take some time to understand
;; how to use it properly, but that investment will be paid back with clear,
;; concise sequence-wrangling later. With that in mind, read over these for
;; expressions and try to see how each of them produces the same result.
